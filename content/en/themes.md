## Color Themes

Academic comes bundled with a variety of popular themes built-in including:

{{< figure library="true" src="docs/themes.png" >}}

To choose a theme, set the `theme` option in `config/_default/params.toml`.

Alternatively, you can [create your own theme]({{< relref "./docs/customization.md#custom-theme" >}}).

## Fonts

Your theme comes with a _font set_ to style your titles and text, but you may choose to override it by specifying one of the following built-in font sets or [creating your own font set]({{< relref "./docs/customization.md#custom-theme" >}}):

- **Minimal** (modern)
- **Classic** (original Academic v1 style)
- **Rose** (traditional serif)
- **Mr Robot** (futuristic)

To choose a font set, set the `font` option in `config/_default/params.toml`.

### Font Sizes

The font size can be changed all the way from extra small to extra large using the `font_size` option in `config/_default/params.toml`.

## Community Themes
