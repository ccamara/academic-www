## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.1.0:

- [Download the new homepage file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/index.md) and move it to `content/home/index.md`
  - This file now forms the parent of all your homepage sections (without it, your homepage will no longer render)
- Add `headless = true` to the front matter of all *homepage* sections (i.e. all files in `content/home/`) and any [*widget page* sections]({{< relref "../docs/managing-content.md#create-a-widget-page" >}})
- Convert any [*widget pages*]({{< relref "../docs/managing-content.md#create-a-widget-page" >}}) by:
   - Deleting their `_index.md` file
   - Creating an `index.md` file with the [new widget page front matter]({{< relref "../docs/managing-content.md#create-a-widget-page" >}})

## Publications

- Added **Preprint**, **Thesis**, and **Patent** as publication types (#769)
  - [View the new list of mappings]({{< relref "../docs/managing-content.md#create-a-publication" >}})
  - Note that previous "Manuscript" type was renamed to "Preprint"

## Widgets

- Improve appearance of **Experience & Accomplishments** widgets
  - New mobile first approach improves style of widgets on small devices
- [Add option to customize section spacing]({{< relref "../docs/page-builder.md#spacing" >}})
- Fix citation view not working in Pages or Featured widgets (#961)
- Fix tag and category filters not working in Pages and Featured widgets (#989)
