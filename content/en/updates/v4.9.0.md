## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.9 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Now also **edit authors, talks, publications, and projects online in the admin panel**
- Use **emojis and custom SVG images as icons** in the Featurette (skills) widget
- Ability to write the **names of authors, tags, and categories** in **Unicode (e.g. Chinese)**
- More **intuitive** approach for users to **choose a light, dark, or automatic (system default) appearance**
- **Screen reader** support added for featured images
- Initial support for **Right to Left (RTL) languages**

## Emojis and custom SVG images as icons

Use **emojis and custom SVG images as icons** in the Featurette (skills) widget.

Icon pack "emoji" gives you the ability to use **emojis as icons**

- [See all icons](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
- Enter the emoji shortcode, such as <pre>:smile:</pre>, in Academic's `icon` field

Icon pack "custom" gives you the ability to use **custom SVG icons**

- Create an SVG icon in your favorite image editor or download one from a site such as [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- Place the custom SVG icon in `assets/images/icon-pack/`, creating the folders if necessary
- Reference the SVG icon name (without `.svg` extension) in the `icon` field

Examples for use in Featurette (skills) widget:

```
# Uncomment to use emoji icons.
# [[feature]]
#  icon = ":smile:"
#  icon_pack = "emoji"
#  name = "Emojiness"
#  description = "100%"  

# Uncomment to use custom SVG icons.
# Place custom SVG icon in `assets/images/icon-pack/`, creating folders if necessary.
# Reference the SVG icon name (without `.svg` extension) in the `icon` field.
# [[feature]]
#  icon = "your-custom-icon-name"
#  icon_pack = "custom"
#  name = "Surfing"
#  description = "90%"
```

## More intuitive appearance selector

{{< figure library="1" src="docs/appearance-chooser.png" title="Version 4.9 makes choosing a site appearance even more intuitive with textual labels rather than icons for the _light_, _dark_, and _auto (system default)_ modes." >}}

Rather than a 3-way icon-based toggle through light, dark, and automatic modes, present the user with a dropdown list of modes displayed in full textual representation. See #1596.

Adds language pack options for translating _Light_ (`theme_light`), _Dark_ (`theme_dark`), and _Automatic_ (`theme_auto`).

## Integration with Netlify Identity for Netlify CMS

[Adds a `[cms]` section](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/5738cdd41e547d6527c1d30816ee82b55d57dedd#diff-8b291e059fa3d9923251f60f22e0ef49) in `params.toml` to configure CMS integration.

## Screen reading featured images

An optional `alt_text` parameter can be added when specifying a featured `image` in a page's front matter. Alt text is used to describe the image when the page is read aloud by a screen reader. See #1592.

Additionally, the profile photo alt text has been improved from "avatar" to the person's name, in alignment with major CMS and social sites.

## Breaking changes

- **Hugo Extended v0.65+** required (tested with v0.69.2)
- Rename the `name` field to `title` in author profiles within the `author/` folder - [view example](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/601620c7a66212e2da873b2e3780a8051b60b79e#diff-eab95e193c42e9d9b63e6d1aea2fc132)
- Add support for **editing talks, publications, and projects in Netlify CMS** in addition to **fixing `TypeError: e.replace is not a function` error** when using _Netlify CMS_ (#1593)
  - Update your `static/admin/config.yml` file from https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/exampleSite/static/admin/config.yml
- Make taxonomy URLs singular, consistent with other Academic pages by adding the following to your [config/_default/config.toml](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/601620c7a66212e2da873b2e3780a8051b60b79e#diff-8d0f7bcc0d4bed4832625ea6b50478e1) file:
   ```toml
   # Workaround Hugo publishing taxonomy URLs as plurals - consistently use singular across Academic.
   [permalinks]
     authors = "/author/:slug/"
     tags = "/tag/:slug/"
     categories = "/category/:slug/"
     publication_types = "/publication-type/:slug/"
   ```

**Optional Changes**

- For non-English sites, add language pack options for translating _Light_ (`theme_light`), _Dark_ (`theme_dark`), and _Automatic_ (`theme_auto`). Refer to the docs on customising the interface language for more info.

## Fixes

- Fix social sharing image for author pages
  - The social sharing logic was attempting to use the legacy system of defining the avatar image name in `site.Params.avatar`, however since the author system was added to Academic, `site.Params.avatar` is now a group of params and the avatar itself is stored in the author's page bundle.
  - Hence, use the avatar in the author's page bundle (if it exists) to represent an author page
  - This bug could affect the image used to represent a page in social sharing and RSS

## Kickstart Fixes

Fixes to the Kickstart template include:

- Fixes `TypeError: e.replace is not a function` error when using Netlify CMS. See #1593.
  - See Breaking Changes section above to apply the fix

## Language

- Initial support added for Right To Left (RTL) languages
- Add Arabic (ar) language pack (#1642, #1654)
- Add Somali language pack (#1607)
- Add Lithuanian language pack (#1617)
- Fix Czech translation (#1597)
- Update NL translation (#1622)
