## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the November 2018 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- New **project showcase** layout to showcase large images in the project widget, as seen in the screenshot below
  - In [`home/projects.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/projects.md), set `view = 2` to use
- Easily create **image galleries** by [adding images to an album folder within a **page bundle**]({{< relref "../docs/writing-markdown-latex.md#image-gallery" >}})
- Featured images can now optionally be [restricted to **page previews only**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/789)
- Support for [custom link buttons **with icons**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/787) on any page
  - For example, link your project to social media pages
- Use the email icon in the About widget to link to the contact form
  - Just set `link = "#contact"` (substituting *contact* with the filename of your contact widget) under `[[params.social]]` in `config.toml`
- Posts can now be **associated with projects** and listed on the project page
  - To associate a post, add `projects = ["my-project-name"]` to its front matter
- **YAML front matter** is now supported for talks

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v3.0.0:

- Requires Hugo v0.50+
- [View changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0#files_bucket) to `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
- CSS class names of project tags in the project widget are now prefixed with `js-id-` to namespace them and prevent clashes with existing CSS classes. Migrate any old filter `tag`s in `projects.md` that are prefixed with a `.` to the new `.js-id-` prefix. Tags which are not prefixed with a `.` do not need migrating.
  
## Widgets

- Project Widget: add project showcase layout, set `view = 2` in `projects.md` to use
- Project Widget: revert card view to use resized images rather than cropped images
- Project Widget: fix project filters for tags with non-ASCII (i18n) characters
- Project Widget: add single column wide layout for project widget, to use set `widget_layout` in `projects.md`
- Project Widget: add `flip_alt_rows` widget option to flip alternate rows in showcase mode
- About Widget: support `[[params.social]]` links to homepage sections
  - Enables using the email icon in the About widget to link to the contact form
- Contact Widget: do not require email if using Netlify contact form 
- Experience Widget: respect the `date_format` option for experience widget
  
## Content pages

- `url_` link buttons can now be added for projects
- all link buttons now appear in page header rather than under a 'links' section within the page
- feat: Add support for icons in `url_custom` - [docs](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/787)
- Markdown slides can now be linked from any page by using new `slides` option
- feat(project): list associated posts
- feat(talk): support YAML front matter for talks 
- feat(page): re-apply markdownify on author names 

## Shortcodes

- feat(shortcodes): add support for image gallery in page bundle
