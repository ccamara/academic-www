Welcome to the v4.8 release of Academic.

{{< figure library="1" src="releases/v4.8-netlify-cms.png" title="Version 4.8 adds support for editing your content online in [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)." >}}

There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- **Admin interface to easily edit content online**
  - Support for writing blog posts and editing privacy policy and terms pages with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
  - [Get started editing your content online](#netlify-cms)
- The **shape of avatars** can now be configured as a square or circle
  - See [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section below
- **New _icon_ shortcode** added to **render icons** within Markdown content
  - [See the documentation and demo of the new shortcode]({{< relref "writing-markdown-latex.md#icons" >}})
- Show **profile cards for all page authors**, not just the first author
  - If `profile` in `params.toml` is set to `true`, an author profile card will be displayed at the end of the page for every author (assuming that a profile has been setup for them under `content/authors/`)
- Add ID to figures to make them linkable (#1475)
  - Right click a figure and click _Inspect_ in your browser to grab the value of the figure's `id` field to use for [linking](({{< relref "writing-markdown-latex.md#links" >}})) in the form `[a link to a figure](#figure-FIGURES-CAPTION)`
- **Filter by author in instances of the Pages and Featured widgets**
  - Under `[content.filters]` in the widget front matter add the username in the new `author` filter, e.g. `author = "admin"`
- Add **option to link to archive of all pages of that type from the Feature widget**
  - E.g. if you show featured publications, you can show a link to all publications under the featured publications
  - To add a "See all" link underneath featured content, set `link_to_archive = true` under the `[content]` section in the front matter of the Featured widget
- Re-adds support for **opening external Markdown links in new tabs** using Hugo's new render hooks (the feature broke in Hugo v0.60 and was replaced with an alternative approach in Hugo v0.62)
- Fixes support for **customising font themes with font names containing spaces**
- **Fixes external links opening both in current tab and in a new tab when using Google Analytics** (via `google_analytics` in `params.toml`)
- **Fixes lazy loading of images causing inaccurate anchor scrolling and active link highlighting**
  - As of a previous release, gallery and figure images are lazy loaded to speed up page load. However, lazy loading without initial image sizes defined can lead to inaccurate anchor scrolling and active link highlighting as the anchor offset changes after an uncached image occurring before the anchor is lazily loaded. This update helps resolve this. See [#1199 comment](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1199#issuecomment-577932174).
  
## Breaking changes

- **Hugo Extended v0.62+ required** - tested with [v0.63.1](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/0.63.1) and [v0.66.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/0.66.0) and 
- If using Netlify, edit the Hugo version in `netlify.toml` to `0.66.0`

See the latest [parameters](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/v4.8.0/exampleSite/config/_default/params.toml#L165) for help upgrading the following params:

- `shape` option added under new `[avatar]` section in `params.toml`
- `gravatar` option moved under new `[avatar]` section in `params.toml`

## Netlify CMS

We have added support for writing blog posts and editing privacy policy and terms pages with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), a free (open source) online content editor. We hope to expand support to other page types in the future.

To use,

- [Login to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), find the site you deployed with Netlify, and add yourself as an editor under the _Identity_ section
- Copy the [_admin_ folder](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart/tree/master/static/admin) over to your `static/` folder and push your changes to your remote Git repository, such as Github
- Wait for your updated site to successfully deploy with Netlify, and head over to `YOUR_SITE.com/admin/` to view your content management panel

You can now easily edit blog posts online, as in the [screenshot above](#figure-version-48-adds-support-for-editing-your-content-online-in-netlify-cmshttpswwwnetlifycmsorg).

Note that you **don't** need to *deploy* a site with *Netlify.com* in order to use *Netlify CMS*. However, in the default Netlify CMS provided, we assume the site is deployed with *Netlify.com* as we leverage its Identity feature to setup and authenticate people as content editors.

For multilingual sites, the content paths will need modifying appropriately in the Netlify CMS config file at `static/admin/config.yml`.

## Fixes

- Fix logo in navbar transforming into site title on mobile. See #1439. Fixes #1507.
- Fix issue with taxonomy links (such as author links) breaking when the term name (such as author name) contains punctuation or certain other non-ASCII characters (Fixes #1575 and #1563)
  - Ensure `removePathAccents = true` in `config.toml` to workaround the Hugo bug: gohugoio/hugo#5687
- Remove space after author names in MLA citation list (#1536)
- Add support for external_link in archives
  - Improves consistency: external projects are now opened in new tab whether they are viewed from the Portfolio widget or archive page. See #1525.
- Only allow auto day/night when day_night enabled. See #1526.
- Fix inconsistent breakpoints for body margin-top and navbar height 
- Fix color of back to top arrow in dark mode

## Language Packs

- Add Czech language (#1555)
- Add Latvian language (#1531)
- Add Khmer language (#1523)
- Update Basque (#1539)
- Update Korean (#1538)

## Misc

- add options to customise length of listing summaries (#1374)
  - When `summary` is defined, the full summary text is now shown in listings
  - Add `summaryLength = 30` (length in words) to `config.toml` to customise automatic summaries from using `&lt;!--more--&gt;` tag or full content (when `summary` and `abstract` are not defined)
  - Add `abstract_length = 135` (length in characters) to `params.toml` to customise truncation when `abstract` is used as the summary
- style: upgrade Bootstrap from 4.3.1 to 4.4.1
