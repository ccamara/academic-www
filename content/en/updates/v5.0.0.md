## How do I upgrade my site?
   
*Want to update to this version?* Refer to the [update guide]({{< relref "../docs/update.md" >}}) in conjunction with the  changes mentioned below.

Note that if you are running the _master_ (development) version rather than an official tagged release, some of these changes may already have been applied.

### Supported Hugo Versions

This release is compatible with **Hugo Extended v0.73-0.74**

- If you deploy your site with Netlify, update `HUGO_VERSION` in your `netlify.toml` to `"0.74.3"`.
- If you run Hugo on your computer, [update the Hugo Extended app](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-hugo) to a compatible version

### Site Changes

1. Add the following lines to your `config/_default/params.toml` - [view example](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/exampleSite/config/_default/params.toml):
    ```toml
    # PLACE THESE PARAMS IN THE MAIN CONFIG SECTION (NOT UNDER ANY [SUBSECTION])
    
    # Show related content at the bottom of pages?
    show_related = {docs = true, page = false, post = true, project = true, publication = true, talk = true}
    
    # Show a copyright license from creativecommons.org in the site footer?
    # Page specific copyright licenses are also possible by adding this option to a page's front matter.
    copyright_license = {enable = false, allow_derivatives = false, share_alike = true, allow_commercial = false, notice = "This work is licensed under {license}"}
    
    # Highlight the site author (superuser) in author lists? (true/false)
    highlight_superuser = false
    
   # PLACE THIS NEW [CMS] CONFIG SECTION AT THE END OF THE FILE
   
    ############################
    ## Content Management System
    ############################
    [cms]
     # See https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/
     netlify_cms = true
   
   ############################
   ## Icon Pack Extensions
   ############################
   [icon.pack]
     ai = false  # Academicons icon pack https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/
    ```
1. Customize the new options above to your liking
   - Set `ai = true` above if your site uses the academic (ai) icon pack
1. The media library folder is now configurable, with the default changing from `static/img/` to `static/media/` as it can now contain any kind of media. Either:
   - Rename your site's `static/img/` folder to `static/media/` (and update any references to the `img/` folder in your Markdown files);
   - **OR**, add `media_dir = "img"` to `params.toml` to continue using the legacy location
1. To align better with the Hugo framework, rename the `name` field to `title` in author profiles within the `author/` folder and ensure each author profile is within its own folder - [view example](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/601620c7a66212e2da873b2e3780a8051b60b79e#diff-eab95e193c42e9d9b63e6d1aea2fc132)
   - E.g. `name: Nelson Bighetti` is renamed to `title: Nelson Bighetti` in `content/authors/admin/_index.md`
1. If you use the Netlify CMS admin panel, update your `static/admin/config.yml` file from https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/exampleSite/static/admin/config.yml
   - This change adds support for **editing talks, publications, and projects in Netlify CMS** in addition to **fixing `TypeError: e.replace is not a function` error** when using _Netlify CMS_ (#1593)
1. Make taxonomy URLs singular, consistent with other Academic pages by adding the following to your [config/_default/config.toml](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/601620c7a66212e2da873b2e3780a8051b60b79e#diff-8d0f7bcc0d4bed4832625ea6b50478e1) file:
   ```toml
   # Workaround Hugo publishing taxonomy URLs as plurals - consistently use singular across Academic.
   [permalinks]
     authors = "/author/:slug/"
     tags = "/tag/:slug/"
     categories = "/category/:slug/"
     publication_types = "/publication-type/:slug/"
   ```

**Optional Changes**

- Update your `data/page_sharer.toml` (if exists) to [open WhatsApp sharing links in the WhatsApp mobile app](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/67028328d07d74fa8b76f5d4b5dc75d647c12531) rather than the web app
- For non-English sites, add language pack options for translating _Light_ (`theme_light`), _Dark_ (`theme_dark`), and _Automatic_ (`theme_auto`). Refer to the docs on customising the interface language for more info.
- Convert any pages using the _docs_ type to use the more intuitive [_books_ type]({{< relref "../docs/managing-content.md" >}})
  - _docs_ type is still available to use, but may be deprecated at some stage
  - the _books_ type doesn't require any `menu` items to be created

## New features for authors

### Highlight yourself in author lists

To **highlight the site author** (superuser) in author lists, set the following in `params.toml`:

    highlight_superuser = true

Remember to check that `superuser: true` in the user account for the site author, where the default user account can be found at `content/authors/admin/_index.md`, and that your pages reference the _username_ of the author rather than the _display name_ of the author. The _username_ is defined as the name of the folder containing the user account and may or may not be the same as the _display name_ in the `title` field of the user account.

For example, in the front matter of a page, we can specify the username of the site author, and it will then be formatted in bold:

    authors:
    - admin

### Add author notes for affiliations and contributions

**Author notes** can be added to a page's front matter in the form:

    authors:
    - "Someone"
    - "Someone else"
    author_notes:
    - "Equal contribution"
    - "Equal contribution"

where the index of each author note corresponds with an author in the `authors` list.

An author note is rendered as a tooltip next to an author's name.

## Emojis and custom SVG images as icons

Use **emojis and custom SVG images as icons** in the **Featurette (skills) widget**.

In the future, [we plan to extend support for emojis and custom SVG icons to other Academic components](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1698).

Icon pack "emoji" gives you the ability to use **emojis as icons**

- [See all icons](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
- Enter the emoji shortcode, such as <code>:</code><code>heart</code><code>:</code>, in Academic's `icon` field

Icon pack "custom" gives you the ability to use **custom SVG icons**

- Create an SVG icon in your favorite image editor or download one from a site such as [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- Place the custom SVG icon in `assets/images/icon-pack/`, creating the folders if necessary
- Reference the SVG icon name (without `.svg` extension) in the `icon` field

Examples for use in Featurette (skills) widget:

```
# Uncomment to use emoji icons.
# [[feature]]
#  icon = ": heart :"  # Remember to remove the spaces around the colons.
#  icon_pack = "emoji"
#  name = "Emojiness"
#  description = "100%"  

# Uncomment to use custom SVG icons.
# Place custom SVG icon in `assets/images/icon-pack/`, creating folders if necessary.
# Reference the SVG icon name (without `.svg` extension) in the `icon` field.
# [[feature]]
#  icon = "your-custom-icon-name"
#  icon_pack = "custom"
#  name = "Surfing"
#  description = "90%"
```

## Create spoilers

To create a spoiler:

    {{</* spoiler text="Click to view the spoiler" */>}} You found me! {{</* /spoiler */>}}

[View the spoiler demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/writing-technical-content/)

## Choose a copyright license

Enables adding Creative Commons copyright licenses on both site wide and per page basis with the new `params.toml` and front matter option:

`copyright_license = {enable = false, allow_derivatives = false, share_alike = true, allow_commercial = false, notice = "This work is licensed under {license}"}`

## Create buttons and call-to-actions

**Create buttons and call-to-actions** with new shortcodes.

Examples coming soon.

## More intuitive appearance selector

{{< figure library="1" src="docs/appearance-chooser.png" title="Version 4.9 makes choosing a site appearance even more intuitive with textual labels rather than icons for the _light_, _dark_, and _auto (system default)_ modes." >}}

Rather than a 3-way icon-based toggle through light, dark, and automatic modes, present the user with a dropdown list of modes displayed in full textual representation. See #1596.

Adds language pack options for translating _Light_ (`theme_light`), _Dark_ (`theme_dark`), and _Automatic_ (`theme_auto`).

## Integration with Netlify Identity for Netlify CMS

[Adds a `[cms]` section](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/5738cdd41e547d6527c1d30816ee82b55d57dedd#diff-8b291e059fa3d9923251f60f22e0ef49) in `params.toml` to configure CMS integration.

## Screen reading featured images

An optional `alt_text` parameter can be added when specifying a featured `image` in a page's front matter. Alt text is used to describe the image when the page is read aloud by a screen reader. See #1592.

Additionally, the profile photo alt text has been improved from "avatar" to the person's name, in alignment with major CMS and social sites.

## Fixes

- Fix social sharing image for author pages
  - The social sharing logic was attempting to use the legacy system of defining the avatar image name in `site.Params.avatar`, however since the author system was added to Academic, `site.Params.avatar` is now a group of params and the avatar itself is stored in the author's page bundle.
  - Hence, use the avatar in the author's page bundle (if it exists) to represent an author page
  - This bug could affect the image used to represent a page in social sharing and RSS

## Language Packs

- Initial support added for Right To Left (RTL) languages
- Add Arabic (ar) language pack (#1642, #1654)
- Add Somali language pack (#1607)
- Add Lithuanian language pack (#1617)
- Fix Czech translation (#1597)
- Update NL translation (#1622)
