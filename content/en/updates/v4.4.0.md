## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the **EPIC** v4.4 release of Academic. There are a large number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- [**Generate diagrams and flowcharts from text**]({{< relref "writing-markdown-latex.md#diagrams" >}}), in a similar manner as Markdown
  - See the new [**technical content writing demo**](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/writing-technical-content/) and the *Diagrams* section below
- **New improved look for featured images**
  - [Add `placement` option](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1175) for featured `image` in front matter. Placement options: 1 = Full column width, 2 = Out-set, 3 = Screen-width. Defaults to 1, full column width.
  - Deprecates the split title/image style that was shown on XL displays
  - [See the posts in the latest Demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/#posts) for an example
- Write **math** more easily
  - Add `markup: mmark` to the front matter of a page containing math
  - Use `$$...$$` for inline and block math 
  - There is no longer a need to escape inline or block math in the body to prevent it being parsed as Markdown
- New **Mr Robot theme** (see below)
  - To try it out, set `color_theme = "mr_robot"` and `font_theme = "mr_robot"` in `config/_default/params.toml`
- New **Rose theme** (see below)
  - To try it out, set `color_theme = "rose"` and `font_theme = "rose"` in `config/_default/params.toml`
- New **Strawberry theme** (see below)
  - To try it out, set `color_theme = "strawberry"` and `font_theme = "default"` in `config/_default/params.toml`
- The **Page Sharer** buttons can now be easily [**customized**]({{< relref "customization.md#page-sharer" >}})
  - Select which social networks to show and configure the order of the sharing buttons
- Flexibility to **write image gallery captions using Markdown and Emojis**
- **Multi-day events** are now supported
  - Previously, the talk layout was intended only for talks (intra-day events). Now, multi-day events are supported.
- **Click on a figure to view** the full size image in a **lightbox**
  - Example given an image `example.png` in `static/img/`, add the following shortcode to the body of a Markdown page: `{{</* figure library="true" src="example.png" lightbox="true" */>}}`
- **Automatically highlight the active page section** in the table of contents displayed in the right sidebar (for pages using the *docs* layout)
- Markdown **asides** supported - also referred to as *notices* or *hints*
  - Add `markup: mmark` to the front matter of a page
  - Write an aside by prefixing a paragraph with `A>`
  - Easier than using the [Alert shortcode]({{< relref "writing-markdown-latex.md#alerts" >}})
- **Allow visitors to edit pages** on GitHub
  - `edit_page` option can be added to `params.toml`. Set `repo_url` to `""` to prevent visitors editing pages.
  - For example, `edit_page = {repo_url = "https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>", editable = {docs = true, page = true, post = true}}`
  - Currently works for GitHub repos and pages using the *page*, *post*, or *docs* layouts.
- **Automatically turn on night mode if visitor prefers dark themes**
  - Currently works with the Mac OS dark/light theme preferences
- Many fixes (see _Misc_ section below)

### Improved technical content writing

{{< figure library="true" src="docs/writing-technical-content.gif" title="Improved technical content writing." lightbox="true" >}}

### Diagrams

You can generate diagrams and flowcharts from text, in a similar manner as Markdown.

Just add `diagram: true` to a page's YAML front matter and insert your [Mermaid diagram syntax](https://mermaidjs.github.io) in the *Diagram* shortcode and that's it. For example,

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        A[Hard edge] -->|Label| B(Round edge)
        B --> C{Decision}
        C -->|One| D[Result one]
        C -->|Two| E[Result two]
    ```

renders as

{{< diagram >}}
graph LR;
    A[Hard edge] -->|Label| B(Round edge)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result one]
    C -->|Two| E[Result two]
{{< /diagram >}}

### Stunning new themes

Check out the stunning new **Mr Robot**, **Rose**, and **Strawberry** themes that have been added:

{{< figure library="true" src="docs/themes.png" >}}

To try **Mr Robot**, set `color_theme = "mr_robot"` and `font_theme = "mr_robot"` in `config/_default/params.toml`.
  
To try **Rose**, set `color_theme = "rose"` and `font_theme = "rose"` in `config/_default/params.toml`.

To try **Strawberry**, set `color_theme = "strawberry"` and `font_theme = "default"` in `config/_default/params.toml`.

Note that **Minimal** corresponds to the **Default** theme (`color_theme = "default"`). The Default theme will be renamed to _Minimal_ in the next release, v4.5.

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.3:

- *Cupcake* color theme and *Playfair* font theme have been deprecated. Check out the new Mr Robot, Rose, and Strawberry themes above.
- If you are using `head_custom.html` for custom `<head>` HTML, it must be renamed to `custom_head.html`
- If you are overriding any of Academic's layout files, you may need to re-apply your HTML modifications to the [updated layouts which inherit from a new base template](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/pull/1115)
- A Cite button for publications will only be generated when a `cite.bib` file is present in its folder

## Publications

- feat: Only generate Cite button when `cite.bib` is present
  - Enables users to place other *.bib files in the folder, to be used for other purposes such as Blogdown bibliographies.

## Widgets

- Portfolio: add Compact view
- Portfolio: refactor List view to be consistent with the standard List views
  - Now, Portfolio's List and Compact views are just wrappers around the standard List and Compact views
- Portfolio: fix summary in Showcase view not falling back to use Content. Fixes #1165.

## Docs

- **Automatically highlight the active page section** in the table of contents displayed in the right sidebar
- Add support for page bundles when using the *docs* layout
  - Enables placing course/documentation files within their own folder, e.g. `courses/example/intro.md` can be renamed to `courses/example/intro/index.md` if desired
  
## Misc

- for personal sites, link a superuser's profile box to the homepage rather than their profile page
- fix case where social sharing links are empty
- style: make tables responsive (fixes display issues with wide tables)
- convert archetypes from TOML to YAML
- fix Academic's RSS template not applied to sections or taxonomies
- fix font-family for code snippets no longer loaded from font theme

- fix: improved HTML5 validation
- feat: always use https scheme for assets
- fix: if comment count enabled, show only on supported pages
- fix: navbar active link highlighting and scrolling - Fixes #1199
  - Fixes edge case caused due to responsive navbar height. More specifically, a possible race condition between Scrollspy init and updating its offset
  - Fixes some edge cases caused due to responsive navbar height and dynamic Portfolio widget height, as well as case where offset was non-integer, requiring float to be rounded up
- fix: CTA icon in Slider widget only works with fas icon pack (#1189)
- fix: opening lightbox or search modal causes navbar to move
- fix(js): Chinese TOC links not scrolling to ID on click (Fix #1178)
- fix(search): browser back button after searching does not behave properly
- fix(search): after dialog closes, results reappear on refresh
