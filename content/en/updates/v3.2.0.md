Also, the Academic **ecosystem has grown to include the following projects**:

* **[Academic Scripts](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-scripts):** Scripts to help migrate content to new versions of Academic
* **[Project KickstartR](https://github.com/sourcethemes/project-kickstart-r):** Create a Project, Team, or Conference **Landing Page** and **Knowledge Sharing Platform** with (R) Markdown

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v3.1.1:

- [View changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v3.1.1...v3.2.0#files_bucket) to `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
- Search widget is deprecated and `content/home/search.md` should be removed
- `url_project` can now only be used to link pages to external websites. To link a page to a project page, use `projects` option.  

## Multilingual

- Fix Hero widget and search index for multilingual sites (#820)
  - Enables searching for content in the current language

## Other

- Fix Twitter sharing (#813)
  - Use small Twitter card for small images
  - Consider featured image and avatar image when computing optimal image to use in Twitter card
- Refactor JS: shorten MathJax filename and minify + fingerprint assets (#768)
  - Remove fingerprinting from MathJax config JS to shorten its generated filename. Reduces chance of JS filenames becoming too long for user's OS to handle due to long Sha512 asset fingerprinting.
  - Minifies and fingerprints Academic's own JS for faster loading and to prevent old versions getting cached by web browser
  - Refactors Algolia search JS into its own file
