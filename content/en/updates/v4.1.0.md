## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.1 release of Academic. This version is all about **widgets and publications**! There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- [**Publication Search**](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/)
  - In addition to the site search, a **search box has been added to the publication archive to enable filtering publications by any attribute**
  - This enables visitors to more **easily discover relevant content** by filtering author, publication, etc.
- [**Hero widget makeover**](https://academic-demo.netlify.com)
  - The Hero widget now supports multiple paragraphs and displaying an image (in addition to the optional background image)
  - [View the new hero options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home/hero.md) used to create the Demo
- Easily **apply a background to any homepage section**
  - Choose from a range of background options including **color, gradient, and image**
  - See the [Demos section](https://academic-demo.netlify.com#demos) and its corresponding [front matter options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home/demo.md)
- Create a **Featured Blog Posts section** using the new **Featured widget**
  - The flexibility of the new **Featured widget** can be seen in the updated [`featured.md`](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home)
- The **Photo Gallery** now generates **web-friendly thumbnails**
  - It's no longer necessary to use third party software to make photos web-friendly
- The **Talk section can now be split** into a **Past Talks** section and an **Upcoming Talks** section
  - Refer to the new `exclude_past` and `exclude_future` filters in the [demo Talk section](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home)

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.0.0:

- Rename `abstract_short` in publications and talks to `summary` (if used)
- Rename `url_custom` to `links` in front matter of content (if used)
- Remove `[header]` from the Hero widget (if used) and replace it with the [new `[background]` options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home/hero.md)
- The *Hero Carousel* widget has been renamed to *Slider*
  - If using it, update `widget` in the front matter to `widget = "slider"`
- Posts, Talks, and Publications widgets have been replaced with a **Pages** widget
  - [Upgrade the front matter of your Posts, Talks, and Publications sections to the new version](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home)
- Featured Talks/Publications widgets have been replaced with a **Featured** widget
  - [Upgrade the front matter of your Featured Talks and Featured Publications sections to the new version demoed in `featured.md`](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home)
- Projects and Custom widgets have been replaced with the **new Portfolio and Blank widgets**
  - Essentially, the Projects and Custom widgets have been renamed and their front matter upgraded to be consistent with the new Pages and Featured widgets (i.e. there are now many more front matter options to personalize their functionality and appearance)
  - Refer to the [Projects and Demo](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/v4.1.0/exampleSite/content/home) sections which use the new Portfolio and Blank widgets
  - Some existing Projects and Custom widgets may possibly continue to work even without upgrading your sections to use these new widgets
- In the **front matter of any talks**, rename `date`, `time_start`, `time_end` options to `publishDate`, `date`, and `date_end`, respectively ([See #721](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/721#issuecomment-468045411))
