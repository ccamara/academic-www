## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the second August 2018 release of Academic. There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- New [**Search engine**]({{< relref "../docs/guide/search.md" >}})
- New [**Carousel widget**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/hero_carousel.md) (#622)
- Support for **Hugo v0.45+**

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v2.3.0:

- [View changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0#files_bucket) to `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
- Download [search.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/search.md) to your `content/home/search.md` if you wish to enable the new search feature
- `disable_sri` parameter has been deprecated
- Setting `highlight_languages` is now only supported in `config.toml` and not on a per page basis

## Content Pages

- Allow a summary to be specified for widget pages (except for the home page which uses the `role` parameter) (#611)
  - Enable `summary = "your page summary"` to be set in a widget page's `_index.md`.    
  - This metadata will then be used to enrich SEO, social sharing, and Academic's search engine. 
- Add support for tags containing spaces
- Fix tag colors when using the dark theme 
- Fix case of highlight style not loading, causing code syntax to be incorrectly highlighted (#614)

## Plugins

- Add [**Search widget**]({{< relref "../docs/guide/search.md" >}})
- Add [**Carousel widget**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/hero_carousel.md) (#622)
- About widget: Fix avatar sometimes not showing in Hugo v0.45+
- Talk widget: Add `exclude_selected` option to front matter of talks widget to hide selected talks (#623)
  - Useful if you are using both the *selected talks widget* and the *recent talks widget*

## Packaging

- Attempt to load local copy of third party JS/CSS assets if available (#489)
  - Allows to create an entirely offline site
  - To use, concatenate vendor JS to `static/js/vendor/main.min.js`, concatenate vendor CSS to `static/css/vendor/main.min.css`, and add fonts to `static/fonts/`
- Theme version is now stored at `themes/academic/data/academic.toml` for those who do not use Git to track Academic's version - this is useful when updating the theme
- `disable_sri` parameter has been deprecated

## Other

- Fix example site (deleted `content/tag/` folder which was causing Hugo to exit with an error)
- Metadata: If set, use the summary parameter in content front matter for the description when a user shares a page on social media
- Setting `highlight_languages` is now only supported in `config.toml` and not on a per page basis
- Exclude all widgets from the sitemap, including those on widget pages other than the home page (#613)
- Add support for Hugo v0.45

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big **_Thank You_** to [all the folks](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/graphs/contributors) that helped to make Academic even better.
